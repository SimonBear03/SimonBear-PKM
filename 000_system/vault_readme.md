this vault is my personal second brain. it is meant to last for years and stay local-first. default flow: capture in inbox → distill into library → use in projects and content.

## folder_structure

- `000_system/` – system notes, rules, templates, meta
- `111_logs/` – time-based logs (daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly, yearly) when I choose to use them
- `222_assets/` – images, screenshots, pdfs and other files linked from notes
- `888_inbox/` – raw captures, research dumps, chat exports; first stop for new information
- `910_projects/` – active deliverables with clear goalsons
- `920_content/` – scripts, drafts, ideas, and retros for XHS, YouTube, articles, etc.
- `999_library/` – distilled, reusable knowledge (methods, topics, frameworks)

## basic_workflow

- capture first: new research, ideas, and chat summaries go to [[888_inbox]]
- distill later: when something is useful long-term, promote it into [[999_library]]
- do work in projects: only create notes in [[910_projects]] for real, active deliverables
- publish from content: use [[920_content]] for posts, scripts, hooks, performance notes
- logs are optional: use [[111_logs]] only when time-based reflection is helpful

## notes_for_ai

- when reading this vault, treat 999_library as long-term knowledge
- treat 910_projects as current work context
- treat 111_logs as time-based memory (if present)
- inbox notes are noisy; prefer distilled notes in library when available
