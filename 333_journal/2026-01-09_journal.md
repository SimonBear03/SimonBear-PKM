# 2026-01-09 – journal

## mood
- curious, a bit overloaded, but also satisfied that things are finally taking shape

## highlights
- finally committed to the idea that this Obsidian vault is my **long-term personal second brain** (SimonBear PKM), not just “a Zillion Visionary workspace”.
- refined the top-level structure: `000_system`, `111_logs`, `222_assets`, `888_inbox`, `910_projects`, `920_content`, `999_library`, and decided to keep everything lowercase + snake_case.
- created/cleaned up core system pieces:
  - [[home]] as a minimal dashboard.
  - [[vault_readme]] to explain the vault structure and workflow.
  - [[AGENTS]] at the repo root so AI agents know how to behave (no random folder spam, use templates, Inbox as default, etc.).
- designed and set up two key templates:
  - [[inbox_research_template]] for research/chat sessions in `888_inbox`.
  - [[library_note_template]] for distilled knowledge in `999_library`.
- talked through the purpose of **111_logs vs 333_journal** and decided:
  - `111_logs/daily` = AI memory / index notes, mostly auto-generated or AI-assisted.
  - `333_journal` = human diary, where real feelings and stories live.
- added a minimal `.gitignore` and thought through how this vault will live as a private GitHub repo.

## thoughts
- it feels good to finally have a “real” first note in `888_inbox` about the AI second brain itself. That’s very meta, but also very on-brand for me.
- separating **AI memory (111_logs)** from **human diary (333_journal)** feels like the right move. I don’t want every emotion dump to become default AI training context; I want some distance.
- I like the idea that templates are now the single source of truth, and [[AGENTS]] only points to them instead of duplicating headings. That should make evolving the system much easier.
- there’s still a lot to figure out (long-term AI memory, web interface, NAS/Tailscale, etc.), but at least the skeleton is there. It’s no longer just “I should build a second brain someday” – it actually exists.
- I can see this PKM tying together Zillion Visionary, Daily Blob, Toolipie, and everything else later. Today is basically the “genesis block” of that system.

## gratitude (optional)
- grateful that modern tools (Obsidian, Cursor, ChatGPT) let me set up something this complex without getting totally lost.
- grateful that I’ve been patient enough with myself to iterate instead of forcing a perfect structure from day one.
- grateful that I caught small details (naming, folders, AI behavior) early, before the vault gets huge.

## questions_to_self (optional)
- how deep do I really want AI to go into my personal life vs just my work and knowledge?
- what’s the minimal viable version of the self-hosted interface I’d actually use regularly?
- how can I make the habit of using `888_inbox` and `333_journal` feel natural, not like “extra work”?

## tomorrow_intentions (optional)
- use the `inbox_research_template` on a **real** topic (e.g., image restoration research) instead of only meta/PKM.
- write another short 333 entry, even if it’s just a few bullets, to start building the journaling habit.
- sketch a simple structure for project notes in `910_projects` (goal, status, next_actions, linked_notes) so I’m ready when I add actual projects.
