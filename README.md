# SimonBear PKM

This repository contains my personal Obsidian vault ("simonbear_pkm"), used as a long-term second brain.

- It is structured into numbered top-level folders (000_system, 888_inbox, 999_library, etc.).
- System docs for how the vault works live in `000_system/`, including:
  - `000_system/vault_readme.md` – vault structure and workflow
  - `000_system/AGENTS.md` – instructions for AI agents working with this repo

This repo is primarily for my own use (Obsidian, Cursor/Codex, and backup/versioning).
